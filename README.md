Student Project
Creating/planning and developing a therapeutic Virtual Reality application for newly deaf people to help ease into their new surroundings.

Hearing difficulties are present amongst approximately 5% of the population with some of this population experiencing a complete loss of hearing. 
This can be a result of hearing loss through accidents or the weakening of hearing skills over time. 
For the creation of a Therapeutic Virtual Reality Experience I planned to integrate a series of Virtual Reality development patterns accompanied by my knowledge of Virtual Reality to produce the following idea:
The experience focusses upon interaction with a virtual friendly looking dog that the user can perform several different activities with. 
The chosen form of the dog represents that of a beagle a small active companion for the user immersed in the virtual experience. 
Becoming deaf can be a frightening experience so this application focusses on the transition through this difficult period,
were the effected person may be feeling alone or scared in their inability to understand through action and emotion,
(as humans we rely heavily on our hearing to help us through every-day tasks). 
The interactions that occur with the dog in the virtual reality environment can provide many different visual cues and sensations that can be interpreted without any use of auditory cues.

-If a dog wags its tail (It may be happy and want to play)
-If the dog isn’t happy it might lie down on the ground and not move at all as it isn’t active.
-If the dog is jumping up and down in front of the user’s line of vision it might want to fetch a ball object that could be implemented within the game.

The experience itself would take place in a simplistic and well-lit environment like a local park with luscious green grass, plenty of trees, and no buildings in site. \
The multitude of soft colours such as the red and white rug that is the experience start are, the bright blue dog’s ball,
and the light greens of the ground and orange or blue of the sky are all visual cues to distract the user from their impaired sense of hearing.
Also, the addition of autonomous movement can reduce the amount of focus required by a user’s auditory senses through flooding their visual senses.
Ultimately acting as a distraction from one sense and steering focus towards another.
